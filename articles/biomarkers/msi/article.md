A "microsatellite" is a small segment of DNA where a short pattern of DNA bases
is repeated several times ([](#cite:PMID12867603)). "Microsatellite instability"
is when the repeated sequences get longer. Microsatellite instability
occurs in several diseases, including some cancers, and neurological diseases
like Huntington's disease. In cancer, microsatellite instability happens if
the DNA [mismatch repair (MMR)](/biomarkers/mmr/index.html) genes are broken
([](#cite:PMC5972025)).

## How is MSI measured?

MSI status can be measured through either genomic sequencing or polymerase chain
reaction (PCR, [](#cite:PMID9823339)). MSI is reported as being either "stable"
or "high" (unstable). Some tests will also report an "MSI-Low" or "MSI-Indeterminate"
category.

Since errors in the [MMR](/biomarkers/mmr/index.html) genes cause microsatellite
instability, "MMR deficiency" will be used as an equivalent to "MSI-high".

### How is MSI measured with PCR?

While PCR is a significantly older method for detecting MSI than genomic sequencing, it
is still widely used. PCR is a commonly available lab technique that uses a carefully
controlled biological reaction to find and amplify specific DNA sequences
([](#cite:PMC4102308)). These DNA sequences can be put through a gel, which allows
a lab technician to identify the length of the DNA sequences.

The standard method for assessing MSI with PCR looks at 5
microsatellites that are frequently enlarged in cancer ([](#cite:PMID9823339)).
The PCR test needs both "normal" (non-tumor) and tumor tissue from a patient.
When the tumor and normal DNA fragment goes through the gel, the lengths of the
fragments are compared. If the length of a microsatellite is changed, then that
microsatellite is considered instable. A patient is considered to be MSI-high
if 2 or more of the 5 microsatellites are unstable.

### How is MSI measured with sequencing?

Clinical sequencing tests typically include multiple microsatellites. For instance,
the Guardant360 panel includes 99 microsatellites ([](#cite:PMID31383735)), while
FoundationOne includes 1,880 microsatellites ([](#cite:PMC7807551)). When the
microsatellites are sequenced, a computer algorithm is used to identify whether
the sizes of the microsatellites have changed.

The large number of microsatellites included in clinical sequencing panels
addresses the major limitation of the standard PCR test for MSI. Since the
PCR test only looks at 5 microsatellites, it may miss MSI-high cases that genomic
sequencing could identify. In a study of prostate cancer patients by [](#cite:PMC5904988),
they found that NGS-based methods correctly identified 93% of MSI-high patients,
while PCR only identified 72% of MSI-high patients.

## What is the typical MSI status for prostate cancer patients?

High microsatellite instability is uncommon in prostate cancer. Several [real world
studies](/evidence/retrospective/index.html) have estimated that 2-5% of prostate
cancer patients have high microsatellite instability.

In prostate cancer, there is some evidence that high microsatellite instability
is correlated with [high tumor mutational burden](/biomarkers/tmb/index.html)
([](#cite:PMC6583915), [](#cite:PMC8972027)).

## How does MSI impact my treatment options?

For a patient with [metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer](/conditions/prostate_cancer/index.html#mCRPC),
getting your MSI assessed may give you additional treatment options. The FDA has granted accelerated
approvals to two medications that can be used to treat any metastatic/recurrent MSI-high solid tumors
that lack other treatment options:

* [Pembrolizumab](/therapies/pembrolizumab/index.html)
* [Dostarlimab-gxly](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-disco-burst-edition-fda-approvals-jemperli-dostarlimab-gxly-patients-mismatch-repair-deficient)
