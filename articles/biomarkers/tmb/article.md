Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is a [biomarker](/biomarkers/index.html) that measures
the total number of mutations that a patient has across their tumor's genome.
When a patient has their tumor sequenced, their TMB value can typically be [calculated
from their sequencing results](#measurement). Metastatic prostate cancer patients who
have a high TMB value may be eligible to take immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as
[Pembrolizumab](/therapies/pembrolizumab/index.html).

## How is TMB measured?

TMB is an estimate of the number of mutations that a tumor has in each "megabase" (Mb) of
the tumor's genome. A "Megabase" is a distance of 100,000 bases (the letters A, C, G,
T) in a genome. As a reference, the human genome has approximately 3 billion bases, or 3,000Mb
([](#cite:PMC9336181)).

To do a "gold standard" measurement of TMB, we take both "normal" (non-cancerous tissue,
typically blood) and tumor tissue from a patient, and perform exome sequencing. Exome
sequencing includes all of the genes in a human that are used to create proteins.
We then count the mutations that are present only in the tumor (and not in the
patient's "normal" sample).

Interpreting TMB measurements requires care. The Friend's of Cancer Research
created a [TMB harmonization project](https://friendsofcancerresearch.org/tmb/) to
understand why TMB results are different across clinical tests ([](#cite:PMID34606929)).
The TMB harmonization project identified several reasons that TMB measurements varied:

* *How many genes were included?* Many clinical sequencing tests cover a limited number of genes, instead of covering
  all of the genes in the human exome. Some "liquid biopsy" tests cover fewer than
  100 genes, while tests that use tumor tissue from a surgical biopsy typically
  include 400-700 genes. In general, panels that cover more genes will be more accurate.
* *Did all providers count variants the same way?* Clinical testing providers use different
  definitions of which variants to count. In their study of 16 clinical tests, they found
  that 7 of 16 (44%) of clinical tests did not count "synonymous" mutations. The
  remaining 9 of 16 (56%) of clinical tests did include "synonymous" mutations in their
  TMB measurement. A "synonymous" mutation is a mutation that changes the DNA for a gene,
  but not the protein.
* *Did the test include a "normal" sample?* Some clinical sequencing tests do not have a
  "normal" sample. To calculate TMB, these tests will typically remove mutations that have
  been seen in genomic databases that do not study cancer. Since all humans have some
  genomic variants that are unique to them ([](#cite:PMC10937371)), tests that lack a
  "normal" sample will overestimate TMB. This problem particularly impacts non-White
  patients, as many historical genomic databases underrepresent non-White individuals.

Once a TMB number has been calculated, TMB is typically divided into "low" and "high"
categories. When approving TMB as a biomarker for [Pembrolizumab](/therapies/pembrolizumab/index.html),
the FDA set the TMB-high threshold at >10 mutations per megabase (mut/Mb). This
threshold was set assuming that patients received the [FoundationOneCDx](https://www.foundationmedicine.com/test/foundationone-cdx)
test. Because clinical tests can vary, if you are using your TMB measurement to make a
treatment decision, you should work with your oncologist to make sure you are using
the right TMB values. 

## What are typical TMB values for prostate cancer patients?

The majority of prostate cancer patients have a low TMB value. Numerous [real world
studies](/evidence/retrospective/index.html) have estimated that 5-10% of
prostate cancer patients will have high TMB.

## How does TMB impact my treatment options?

For a patient with [metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer](/conditions/prostate_cancer/index.html#mCRPC),
getting your TMB tested may give you additional treatment options. Patients who are TMB-high may
be eligible to take [Pembrolizumab](/therapies/pembrolizumab/index.html).
