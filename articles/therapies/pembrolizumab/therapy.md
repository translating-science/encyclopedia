## Does the evidence support using Pembrolizumab to treat prostate cancer?

The evidence for using Pembrolizumab in prostate cancer is currently
inconclusive, and is being actively researched.

The trials that supported the approval of Pembrolizumab for TMB-H and MSI-H/dMMR
metastatic solid cancers included few patients with prostate cancer. The KEYNOTE-158
study (TMB-H solid cancers) did not include any prostate cancer patients who had a
high tumor mutational burden ([](#cite:PMC8416776), [](#cite:PMID32771305)), while the studies
of MSI-H only included 2 prostate cancer patients. Additionally, only 5-10%
of prostate cancer patients will have either of the TMB-H or MSI-H/dMMR biomarker
statuses.

Because the pan-cancer trials used to approve Pembrolizumab only contained a limited
number of prostate cancer patients, it is hard to know if the effectiveness seen in the
trials will replicate for real world prostate cancer patients.

To better answer this question, researchers have looked [retrospectively](/evidence/retrospective_study/index.html)
at real-world patient cases, to better understand how real world patients who have
high [TMB](/biomarkers/tmb/index.html) or high [MSI](/biomarkers/msi/index.html) respond to pembro.

In these studies, there are two concordant studies where prostate cancer patients who had high [microsatelite
instability](/biomarkers/msi/index.html) were likely to respond well to Pembrolizumab. For patients with
high [tumor mutational burden](/biomarkers/msi/index.html), there are discordant results across studies.
This may be explained by some of the results in [](#cite:PMID38341460): in this study, the authors observed
that a significant portion of [TMB-high](/biomarkers/tmb/index.html) prostate cancer patients were also
[MSI-high](/biomarkers/msi/index.html), which may explain some of the responses seen in other studies.
